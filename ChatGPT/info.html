                The fortune cookie is one of the most iconic and festive parts of the Chinese food takeout experience, but there’s more to this humble treat than meets the eye. While it is largely associated with Chinese food restaurants and take-out meals, the fortune cookie doesn’t actually come from China. It is very much a representation of Asian American immigration history, where the crossroads of food, culture, and tradition lead to an entirely new cuisine or dish all its own.
