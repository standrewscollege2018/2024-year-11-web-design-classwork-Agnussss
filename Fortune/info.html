                The fortune cookie is one of the most iconic and festive parts of the Chinese food takeout experience, but there’s more to this humble treat than meets the eye. While it is largely associated with Chinese food restaurants and take-out meals, the fortune cookie doesn’t actually come from China. It is very much a representation of Asian American immigration history, where the crossroads of food, culture, and tradition lead to an entirely new cuisine or dish all its own.

                The fortune cookie is a sweet and crunchy treat that is delivered at the end of a meal when ordering Chinese food takeout or eating. Its defining feature is the fortune, however—the slip of paper with words of wisdom on one side and lucky numbers written on the other. They are made with flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame oil or butter and have a classic snap when they are broken or eaten. Several billion are produced every year, and many folks swear that their lucky numbers have won lottery pots or led to other good fortunes.
